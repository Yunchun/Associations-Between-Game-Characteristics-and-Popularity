# Project Overview

This is the final project for my COGS 108 (Data Science in Practice) taken at UCSD. In our project, we investigated the relationships between different features of a Steam game and game ownership. We analyzed each feature's distribution and visualized their relationship with number of owners. From analysis of these features, we found positive correlations between game ownership and features such as recommendations, and genres. Moreover, we visualized these correlations and computed mathematical correlation equations using quantile regression models. To identify good predictors of game popularity, we also created several models such as Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machines. Given all the models' performances, we found that Logistic Regression would be the best model because its accuracy score is highest and around 0.7.
