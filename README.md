# Project Overview
- Investigated the relationships between different features of a Steam game and game ownership
- Analyzed each feature's distribution and visualized their relationship with number of owners
- Visualized these correlations and computed mathematical correlation equations using quantile regression models
- Built ML models, such as KNN, Decision Tree, SVM, to identify good predictors of game popularity
